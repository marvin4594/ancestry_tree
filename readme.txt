This program takes genealogical data from a gedcom file
and uses it to draw an ancestry tree in pdf and png format,
including portraits of the people from a folder '../portraits'.

The main file is the jupyter notebook 'plot_tree.ipynb'.

Due to privacy reasons neither gedcom file, portraits or
the resulting ancestry tree are included in this
repository. I am working on creating a test case.

The file 'buchheim.py' is taken from
'https://github.com/llimllib/pymag-trees'
and is used to draw n-nary trees, which are used as basis
for the full ancestry tree.
